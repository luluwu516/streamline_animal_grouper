# Streamlit - Animal Grouper

App is designed to group experimental animals by utilizing weight as a key parameter for classification. Like [GUI - Animal Grouper](https://github.com/luluwu516/GUI-animal-grouper), 
it's based on my first side project, [Animal Grouping](https://github.com/luluwu516/animal-grouping), building with Streamlit.

## Deployment
https://luluwu-animalgrouper.streamlit.app/

## Motivation
I had a project about supplement feeding for swine, and before the experiment, I had to group the piglets. I randomly grouped them first, but the deviation of the piglets' weight 
was too large, so I spent more than 1 hour arranging the groups. I did the same thing twice for my project, which was really a waste of time.

After learning Python for one year, I improved the program's design and deployed it on [Streamlit Community Cloud](https://luluwu-animalgrouper.streamlit.app/). It's much easier
to share the link with my friends and help them save their time for animal grouping, which made me full of achievements.
